Variables

Subject:
An integer between 1 and 30
Designates one of 30 subjects who carried Samsung phones for data collection

Activity:
A character string with enumerated values:
WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS STANDING SEATING LAYING

trainingOrTest:
A character string
“training”, “test”
Some of the data was used for training; some for testing. This variable tells what the data in a particular row was used for.

oneDataSet:
A data frame with 10299 observations and 81 variables
The complete data set with all mean- and std-related features, Subject, Activity, and data use (training or test)
mean- and std-related features are numbers between -1 and 1.
See definitions above for Subject and Activity.

meansOfMeanStdbySubjectandActivity:
A data frame with 180 observations and 81 variables
The data set derived from oneDataSet by averaging the values of the linear and angular acceleration variables for each subject and activity
The values of the means are numbers between -1 and 1.
See definitions above for Subject and Activity.

Mean- and std-related features:
Among the initial 561 features in the input data set, we have selected the ones that calculate means or standard deviations. I included features with “meanFreq” in their names on the grounds that I don’t know enough to tell whether that is or is not a useful mean variable. Better safe than sorry. I did not include a set of variables (features 555 to 561) that are computed using a variable called “GravityMean” as the variables themselves are not means - they just happen to use GravityMean as an input (e.g,  
angle(X,gravityMean)). This results in 46 “mean” variables and 33 “standard deviation” variables, for a total of 79 variables.

79 features listed below
A number between -1 and 1.
Each feature selected has the format: 
<time or frequency><<Body or Gravity><Acceleration or Gyro>< <empty>, Jerk, Mag, or JerkMag>.<mean, std, or meanFrequency>.< <empty>, X, Y, or Z axis>
e.g., timeBodyAccelerationJerk.mean.Z, timeBodyGyro.mean.X or timeGravityAccelerationMag.mean
Across from each of the variable you will find its number in the input features file and its original name in that file, to be found in the UCI HAR Dataset, at:

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
