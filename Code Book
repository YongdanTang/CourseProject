COURSE PROJECT CODE BOOK

Variables

Subject:
An integer between 1 and 30
Designates one of 30 subjects who carried Samsung phones for data collection.

Activity:
A character string with enumerated values:
Possible values: WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS STANDING SEATING LAYING

trainingortest:
A character string
Possible values: “training”, “test”
Some of the data was used for training; some for testing. This variable tells what the data in a particular row was used for. Although not called for explicitly, it seemed to me that future users of this script might want to know which subset a particular observation came from.

meanStdData:
A data frame with 10299 observations and 82 variables: Subject, Activity, trainingortest, and 79 features.
The complete data set with all mean- and std-related features, Subject, Activity, and data use (training or test)
mean- and std-related features are numbers between -1 and 1.
See definitions above for Subject, Activity, trainingortest, and definitions below for the features.

meansOfMeanStdbySubjectandActivity:
A data frame with 180 observations and 81 variables: Subject, Activity, and 79 features.
The data set derived from meansStdData by averaging the values of the linear and angular acceleration variables for each subject and activity.
The values of the means are numbers between -1 and 1.
See definitions above for Subject and Activity; definitions below for features.

features:
Mean- and std-related features:
Among the initial 561 features in the input data set, we have selected the ones that calculate means or standard deviations. I included features with “meanFreq” in their names on the grounds that I don’t know enough to tell whether that is or is not a useful mean variable. Better safe than sorry. I did not include a set of variables (features 555 to 561) that are computed using a variable called “GravityMean” as the variables themselves are not means - they just happen to use GravityMean as an input (e.g, angle(X,gravityMean)). This results in 46 “mean” variables and 33 “standard deviation” variables, for a total of 79 variables.

79 features listed below
A number between -1 and 1.
Each feature selected has the format: 
<time or frequency><<Body or Gravity><Acceleration or Gyro>< <empty>, Jerk, Mag, or JerkMag>.<mean, std, or meanFrequency>.< <empty>, X, Y, or Z axis>
e.g., timeBodyAccelerationJerk.mean.Z, timeBodyGyro.mean.X or timeGravityAccelerationMag.mean
Across from each of the variable you will find its number in the input features file and its original name in that file, to be found in the UCI HAR Dataset, at:

Quick guide to which part of a feature name means:
time/frequency: a feature is calculated either from a time series or from a Fast Fourier Transform of the time series.
body/gravity: a feature denotes total acceleration or acceleration from which gravity acceleration has been subtracted.
acceleration/gyro: a feature is calculated from linear acceleration data or from angular acceleration data.
jerk/mag: no idea. I just pass these attributes along.
mean/std: the features we are interested in are computations of means or standard deviations.
X/Y/Z: acceleration axis.
