Repo for script and code book in Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course

In this repo you will find:
- An R script to analyze the UCI HAR data as requested in the Course Project instructions.
- A code book describing the variables involved in the analysis.

The run_analysis.R script assumes the input data is in a folder located in the working directory and called UCI HAR Dataset. Inside that folder, the data is arranged in multiple subfolders. The data can be found at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

If you source the script, it will automatically run and return a tidy set of the means of all the input variables that were means or standard deviation computations of linear and angular acceleration data generated by cell phones as subjects peformed a set of activities. The inputs, which were originally separated into training and testing data, were combined into a single data set to calculate the means in the tidy set.

The variables selected as inputs in the script and the output variables are in the Code Book.
